# Cursed Python
## Animated game using `curses`
### By [PythonLove.com] and Jean Paul

This game is a _proof of concept_. You can create interesting games in your terminal. A lot of people think you need `tkinter` and stuff. But, erm...

...you can do a lot with the terminal. If you allow yourself to be creative.

**Cursed Python** is still work in progress. More features coming soon!
